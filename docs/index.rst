----

``miepython`` is a pure Python module to calculate light scattering by
non-absorbing, partially-absorbing, or perfectly conducting spheres. Mie
theory is used, following `the procedure described by Wiscombe
<http://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/technotes:232>`_. This code has
been validated against his results. 

This code provides functions for calculating the extinction efficiency,
scattering efficiency, backscattering, and scattering asymmetry.
Moreover, a set of angles can be given to calculate the scattering at various
angles for a sphere.

Heads up!
---------
When comparing different Mie scattering codes, make sure that you're
aware of the conventions used by each code.  ``miepython`` makes the
following assumptions

* the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction for absorbing spheres is *negative*.

* the scattering phase function is normalized so it equals the *single scattering albedo* when integrated over 4Ï€ steradians by default.  As of version 2.3, this can be changed (see the normalization notebook for details).

Using miepython
---------------

1. You can install locally using pip::
    
    pip install miepython

2. or `run this code in the cloud using Google Collaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com/github/scottprahl/miepython/blob/master>`_ by selecting the Jupyter notebook that interests you.
