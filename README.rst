________

``miepython`` is a pure Python module to calculate light scattering for
non-absorbing, partially-absorbing, or perfectly-conducting spheres. 

This code provides functions for calculating the extinction efficiency,
scattering efficiency, backscattering, and scattering asymmetry. Moreover, a set
of angles can be given to calculate the scattering for a sphere at each of those
angles.

Mie computations are done following `the procedure described by Wiscombe
<http://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/technotes:232>`_. This code has
been validated against his results. 

Full documentation at <https://miepython.readthedocs.io>

Version 3 changes
-----------------

This version contains major changes to the code base and **has API breaking changes**.
If you don't need the new functionality for fields, then you can continue to use the
last version with the old API: 2.5.5

Version 3.0 has many changes, but the major ones are:

    * a complete overhaul of API
    * added support to calculate Mie coefficients for fields inside sphere
    * future work will implement calculating electric and magnetic fields

Pay Attention!
--------------

When comparing different Mie scattering codes, make sure that you're aware of the conventions used by each code.  ``miepython`` makes the following assumptions:

#. The imaginary part of the complex index of refraction for absorbing spheres is *negative*.  
   Currently if you pass refractive indicies with a positive imaginary value, the refractive
   index is silently converted to a negative value before calculation.

#. The scattering phase function is normalized so it equals the *single scattering albedo* when 
   integrated over 4Ï€ steradians.  The default normalization can now be changed.


Installation
---------------

Use ``pip``::

    pip install miepython

or ``conda``::

    conda install -c conda-forge miepython

An example
----------

The following code::

    import miepython as mie
    
    m = 1.5 - 1j      # refractive index of sphere
    d = 100           # nm diameter of sphere
    lambda0 = 314.15  # nm wavelength in vacuum

    qext, qsca, qback, g = mie.efficiencies(m, d, lambda0)

    print("The extinction efficiency  is %.3f" % qext)
    print("The scattering efficiency  is %.3f" % qsca)
    print("The backscatter efficiency is %.3f" % qback)
    print("The scattering anisotropy  is %.3f" % g)

should produce::

    The extinction efficiency  is 2.336
    The scattering efficiency  is 0.663
    The backscatter efficiency is 0.573
    The scattering anisotropy  is 0.192

There are a few short python scripts in the github repository.
