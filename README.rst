__________

``miepython`` is a pure Python module to calculate light scattering for
non-absorbing, partially-absorbing, or perfectly-conducting spheres. Mie
theory is used, following `the procedure described by Wiscombe
<http://opensky.ucar.edu/islandora/object/technotes:232>`_. This code has
been validated against his results. 

This code provides functions for calculating the extinction efficiency, scattering efficiency, backscattering, and scattering asymmetry. Moreover, a set of angles can be given to calculate the scattering for a sphere at each of those
angles.

Pay Attention!
--------------

When comparing different Mie scattering codes, make sure that you're aware of the conventions used by each code.  ``miepython`` makes the following assumptions

#. the imaginary part of the complex index of refraction for absorbing spheres is *negative*.  

#. the scattering phase function is normalized so it equals the *single scattering albedo* when integrated over 4Ï€ steradians.  As of version 2.3, this can be changed.


Using miepython
---------------

1. You can install locally using pip::
    
    pip install miepython

2. or `run this code in the cloud using Google Collaboratory <https://colab.research.google.com/github/scottprahl/miepython/blob/master>`_ by selecting the Jupyter notebook that interests you.

An example
----------

The following code::

    import miepython
    
    m = 1.5-1j
    x = 1
    qext, qsca, qback, g = miepython.mie(m,x)

    print("The extinction efficiency  is %.3f" % qext)
    print("The scattering efficiency  is %.3f" % qsca)
    print("The backscatter efficiency is %.3f" % qback)
    print("The scattering anisotropy  is %.3f" % g)

should produce::

    The extinction efficiency  is 2.336
    The scattering efficiency  is 0.663
    The backscatter efficiency is 0.573
    The scattering anisotropy  is 0.192
