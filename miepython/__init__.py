Mie scattering calculations for perfect spheres.

Extensive documentation is at <https://miepython.readthedocs.io>

`miepython` is a pure Python module to calculate light scattering of
a plane wave by non-absorbing, partially-absorbing, or perfectly conducting
spheres.

The extinction efficiency, scattering efficiency, backscattering, and
scattering asymmetry for a sphere with complex index of refraction m,
diameter d, and wavelength lambda can be found by::

    import miepython as mie
    qext, qsca, qback, g = mie.efficiencies(m, d, lambda0)

The normalized scattering values for angles mu=cos(theta) are::

    Ipar, Iper = mie.intensities(m, d, lambda0, mu)

If the size parameter is known, then use::

    mie.efficiencies_mx(m, x)

Mie scattering amplitudes S1 and S2 (complex numbers):

    mie.S1_S2(m, x, mu)

Normalized Mie scattering intensities for angles mu=cos(theta)::

    mie.i_per(m, x, mu)
    mie.i_par(m, x, mu)
    mie.i_unpolarized(m, x, mu)

Mie scattering intensities normalized to one when integrated over all angles::

    mie.i_per(m, x, mu, norm='one')
    mie.i_par(m, x, mu, norm='one')
    mie.i_unpolarized(m, x, mu, norm='one')

The scattering matrix

    mie.phase_matrix(m, x, mu)
