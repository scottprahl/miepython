Vector Spherical Harmonics for Mie Scattering.

This module calculates the electric and magnetic vector spherical harmonics (VSH)
required for Mie scattering computations. The functions in this module compute
the VSH corresponding to the m=1 mode, which is commonly used in scattering
problems.

Sign Conventions:

    The sign conventions used in this module follow those presented on the
    "Vector Spherical Harmonics" webpage on Wikipedia as well as those described
    in the paper by Ladutenko (DOI: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2017.01.017).
    In particular, the odd and even modes are consistent with these references.

    The even and odd magnetic modes of Bohren & Huffman are reversed from those
    used here.

Bessel Function Selection:

    The appropriate spherical Bessel function is chosen based on the spatial
    region where the field is evaluated:

        - For points inside the sphere (r < d_sphere/2), the regular spherical
          Bessel functions (``spherical_jn``) are used.
        - For points outside the sphere (r >= d_sphere/2), the spherical Hankel
          functions of the first kind (``spherical_h1``) are employed to represent
          the radiating field.

Functions:

    M_odd(n, k, d_sphere, r, theta, phi)
        Compute the nth odd magnetic vector spherical harmonic (m=1).

    M_even(n, k, d_sphere, r, theta, phi)
        Compute the nth even magnetic vector spherical harmonic (m=1).

    N_odd(n, k, d_sphere, r, theta, phi)
        Compute the nth odd electric vector spherical harmonic (m=1).

    N_even(n, k, d_sphere, r, theta, phi)
        Compute the nth even electric vector spherical harmonic (m=1).

Additional Utility Functions:

    mie_pi(n, theta, deg=False)
        Computes the angular variation (𝜋ₙ(𝜃)) for the electric multipole field,
        based on the associated Legendre polynomial.

    mie_tau(n, theta, deg=False)
        Computes the angular variation (𝛕ₙ(𝜃)) for the magnetic multipole field,
        corresponding to the derivative of the associated Legendre polynomial.
